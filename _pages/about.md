[(日本語)](./about_ja)

I am currently a Master's 2nd-year student at [Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_interdisciplinary.html). I am also doing reseach intership at [Araya Inc.](https://research.araya.org/) supervised by Dr. Ippei Fujisawa and Dr. Ryota Kanai, and hold a position at [AI Alignment Network](https://www.aialign.net/) as a research fellow.

My main research interests are consciousness and AI Alignment. These are coming from rather independent motivations, understanding my inner world and avoiding x-risk, respectively. But I think demystifying the black box of neural networks is the key to both problems. This idea made me start running [a Japanese discord server](https://x.com/rtakatsky/status/1801872360120733860) that's dedicated to mechanistic interpretability.

Through involving in AI alignment I am also growing my interest for Effective Altruism and Rationalism.

During my free time I enjoy playing Bossa nova and playing with my pet dog (Moffy).
